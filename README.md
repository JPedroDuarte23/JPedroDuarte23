## Hello, my name is Jo√£o Duarte, but you can call me JayPy

I'm a Software Engineering student who is in love with Technology and Design. Welcome to my Github profile!
</br>
</br>
Here you will find some of the projects that I've been working on over the last 2 years. Some of them are just exercises that I did in college, and others are complex projects.
</br>
</br>
If you want a recommendation on which project to see, I highly recommend my Pokemon TCG website <a href="https://github.com/JPedroDuarte23/Pokemon_tcg">My Card Dex</a>. This is where I really started programming! I know there are huge mistakes there, and I will revisit it to refactor the code, but I'm proud that I could make this in 6 months of study in college.
</br>
Another recommendation I have is one of my college projects, "Animoons," which is basically a platform for monitoring computers in animation studios. It is separated into two parts: the <a href="https://github.com/AniMoons-SPTech/Java-Monitoons">Back-end</a>, which is in Java, and the <a href="https://github.com/AniMoons-SPTech/MoniToons">Front-end</a>, which is in JavaScript with some code in jQuery.
</br>
Now I'm working on a job platform for people with Down Syndrome, called WeTin. This is my capstone project in college and it will be separated into two modules. The first module has the front-end built in React.js and the back-end in Spring Boot/Java. The second module will involve developing an Android application using Kotlin. I have a special fondness for this project because of its social impact and because it is part of my final project for the Google UX course. In this project, I applied skills in prototyping, user research, benchmarking, user empathy, and various other competencies acquired during the course.
</br> 
For developers and designer like me i have two teachings. The first is that TEST EVERYTHING and the second is that maybe you are not the user(kidding, you are not the user)
